FakeSysKey
===============

This program can be used by scambaiters to replace the actual Syskey program on their VM.  Syskey is a
program that can be used to set a security password on a computer running Windows which must be entered
in order to use the computer.  This is different that the Windows login password.  Scammers will sometimes
set a password and then extort money from victims with the promise of giving control of their computers
back.  Sometimes the scammers will blame a virus or "hackers" for the lock-out.

Fake Syskey will not actually set a password and will display the password that the scammer typed into
the entry field.  This information can be used (assuming they use the same password on the computeres of
multiple victims) to help others recover their computers.

Installation
------------
To simplest way to use the program is to rename FakeSysKey.exe to syskey.exe and place it in a folder that
is ahead of the real Syskey program in your path.

The most fool-proof way to use the program, however, is to replace the actual Syskey program with FakeSysKey.
This will likely require rebooting into safe mode.

Usage
-----
Launch the program like you would run any other Windows program.  Though, this really isn't intended to be
ran by the installer but rather by scammers thinking it's the real SysKey.
